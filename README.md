#Elixer
#### Cross-Mod Compatible Utility Function Library for Modders

Put ```Elixer_Utility.lua``` in a **unique** subdirectory of your mod to avoid any conflicts. If the file path matches any other mod's, the results will be unpredictable.

Call ```Elixer.UseVersion( versionNumber )``` before trying to call any of these functions in your mod to ensure the right versions are loaded into memory
